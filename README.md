# GAN for CIFAR-100

This repository includes a Colab notebook that implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes.

## Overview

- **Notebook:** [GAN_for_cifar100_dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/ibad321/GAN-for-cifar100/blob/main/gan_for_cifar100_dataset.ipynb)
  - Implements a GAN model to generate realistic images from random noise.
  - Contains code for both the generator and discriminator networks.
  - Includes training scripts and visualization of generated images.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Notebook:**
   - Click [Here](https://github.com/ibad321/GAN-for-cifar100/blob/main/gan_for_cifar100_dataset.ipynb) to view the notebook on GitHub.
   - For interactive execution, open the notebook in Google Colab [Here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ibad321/GAN-for-cifar100/blob/main/gan_for_cifar100_dataset.ipynb).

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up the environment.
   - Execute the cells to train the GAN and observe the generated images.

3. **Customization:**
   - Adjust hyperparameters and network configurations directly in the notebook to experiment with different settings.

## Requirements

- **Google Colab:** The notebook is designed to run on Google Colab.
- **Dependencies:** All necessary libraries and packages are included in the Colab environment.
